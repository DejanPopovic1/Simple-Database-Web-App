#Setting up, running and testing the Project
*) Install the latest version of Visual Studio
*) Open the projects solution (.sln) folder
*) If the database called "Authentication" isnt automatically loaded, create a database called "Authentication"
*) The database called "Authentication" is initially empty. Initialise it by running the script called "InitialiseDatabase.sql" which is in the root project folder
*) Run the web app on your local webserver, e.g. IIS Express
*) Try logging in with the name "maryscott@gmail.com" and password "mary"
*) You will see that you may login because these are scripted into the database
*) Once logged in, try changing any of the details. You will see that it updates the corresponding fields
*) Log out
*) Try logging in with the same username but different password and observe the error
*) Tested on Google Chrome Browser

#Assumptions and Features that have not been implemented because they werent specified
*) The two data tables each have a unique key generated by MS SQL
*) Info table has a foreign key and primary key. The foreign key does not equal the primary key. One could argue they should be the same because its a one to one relationship but its actually not one to one. Two different people could have the same Info table values, e.g. Its possible to have same living address and same number in the instance of a spouse using next of kin details
*) Validations could have been stricter, but validations werent specified
*) Going to the Info page forces the user to change password which in the real world shouldnt be the case. It wasnt specified to avoid this scenario
*) The "without using post-back" is a bit ambiguous - I implemented it how I interpreted it
*) Basic security features like Sql string parameterisation are used instead of string concatenation to prevent SQLInjection attacks. There could be some security vulnerabilities but it wasnt specified to firm up security loopholes
